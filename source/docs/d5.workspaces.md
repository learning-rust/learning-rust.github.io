title: Workspaces
---

When the code base is getting larger, you might need to work with **multiple crates on the same project**. Rust supports this via Workspaces. You can **analyze (`cargo check`), build, run tests or generate docs for all crates** at once by running `cargo` commands from the project root.

⭐️ When working on multiple crates same time, there is a higher possibility of having shared dependencies on crates. To prevent downloading and compiling the same dependency multiple times, Rust uses a **shared build directory** under the project root, while running `cargo build` from the project root.

Let's create a library crate with a simple hello world function and a binary crate which uses the library crate.

Assume we run,
```bash
mkdir greetings
touch greetings/Cargo.toml
cargo new greetings/lib --lib
cargo new greetings/examples/hello
```

That generates,
```
greetings
 ├── Cargo.toml
 ├── examples
 │  └── hello
 │     ├── Cargo.toml
 │     └── src
 │        └── main.rs
 └── lib
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
       └── lib.rs
```

We have to modify the following files,
```rust
// 01. greetings/Cargo.toml to mark as a workspace and to add members
[workspace]
members = [
    "lib",
    "examples/hello"
]

// 02.1 greetings/lib/Cargo.toml to change the package name to greetings
[package]
name = "greetings"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Dumindu Madunuwan"]

[dependencies]

// 02.2 greetings/lib/src/lib.rs to add a simple hello world function
pub fn hello() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

// 03.1 greetings/examples/hello/Cargo.toml to add the `greetings` lib as a dependency
[package]
name = "hello"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Dumindu Madunuwan"]

[dependencies]
greetings = { path = "../../lib" }

// 03.2 greetings/examples/hello/src/main.rs to import the `greetings` lib and call its hello world function
extern crate greetings;

fn main() {
    greetings::hello();
}
```

💡 On Linux and Mac, you can run `cargo` commands on each crate without changing the working directory all the times via Subshells (A command list embedded between parentheses). For example, if you are in the `greetings` directory, even you run `(cd examples/hello && cargo run)` your working directory will be kept  as same in `greetings` folder.

> 🔎 [rust-lang/rust source folder](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src) is a good example for a workspace.
