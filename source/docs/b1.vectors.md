title: Vectors
---

If you remember, the array is a fixed-size list of elements, of the same data type. Even with mut, its element count cannot be changed. A vector is kind of **a re-sizable array** but **all elements must be in the same type**.

⭐️ It’s a generic type, written as **`Vec<T>`** . T can have any type, ex. The type of a Vec of i32s is `Vec<i32>`. Also, Vectors always allocate their data in a dynamically allocated heap.

### Create empty vector

```rust
let mut a = Vec::new(); //1.With new() keyword
let mut b = vec![]; //2.Using the vec! macro
```

### Create with data types

```rust
let mut a2: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
let mut b2: Vec<i32> = vec![];
let mut b3 = vec![1i32, 2, 3];//Sufixing 1st value with data type

let mut b4 = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut b5: Vec<i32> = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut b6  = vec![1i32, 2, 3];
let mut b7 = vec![0; 10]; //Ten zeroes
```

### Access and change data

```rust
//Accessing and changing existing data
let mut c = vec![5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
c[0] = 1;
c[1] = 2;
//c[6] = 2; Cannot assign values this way, index out of bounds
println!("{:?}", c); //[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]

//push and pop
let mut d: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
d.push(1); //[1] : Add an element to the end
d.push(2); //[1, 2]
d.pop(); //[1] : : Remove an element from the end


// 🔎 Capacity and reallocation
let mut e: Vec<i32> = Vec::with_capacity(10);
println!("Length: {}, Capacity : {}", e.len(), e.capacity()); //Length: 0, Capacity : 10

// These are all done without reallocating...
for i in 0..10 {
    e.push(i);
}
// ...but this may make the vector reallocate
e.push(11);
```

⭐️ Mainly a vector represent 3 things,
- A **pointer** to the data
- **No of elements** currently have(**length**)
- **Capacity** (Amount of space allocated for any future elements). 

If the length of a vector exceeds its capacity, its capacity will be increased automatically. But its elements will be reallocated(which can be slow). So always use Vec::**with_capacity** whenever it’s possible.

> 💡 The **String** data type is a UTF-8 encoded vector. But you can not index into a String because of encoding.


💯 Vectors can be used with iterators in three ways,

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for i in &v {
    println!("A reference to {}", i);
}

for i in &mut v {
    println!("A mutable reference to {}", i);
}

for i in v {
    println!("Take ownership of the vector and its element {}", i);
}
```
