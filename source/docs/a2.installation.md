## Rustup

There are many ways to install Rust on your system. For the moment the official way to install Rust is using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

> ⭐️ If you are on **Microsoft Windows**, you have to install **Visual C++ Build Tools** 2013 or higher. The recommended way is installing Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools which requires additional 3–4 GBs.

[📖](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs) Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between stable, beta, and nightly compilers and keep them updated. It makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.

[📖](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#installation) Rustup installs `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup` and other standard tools to Cargo's `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`. This is the same directory that `cargo install` will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.

💡 More information can be found on the [Github page of Rustup project](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs).

After installing Rust you can check the current version by typing `rustc --version` or`rustc -V` on your terminal to verify the success of the installation.
