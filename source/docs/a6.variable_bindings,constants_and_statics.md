## Variable bindings, Constants & Statics

⭐️ In Rust, variables are **immutable by default**, so we call them **Variable bindings**. To make them mutable, the `mut` keyword is used.

⭐️ Rust is a **statically typed** language; it checks data types at compile-time. But it **doesn’t require you to actually type it when declaring variable bindings**. In that case, the compiler checks the usage and sets a better data type for it. But for **constants and statics, you must annotate the type**. Types come after a colon(`:`).

> 💭 We use the [data types](a8.primitive_data_types.html) like `bool`, `i32`, `i64` and `f64` in the following examples. But, no need to check them now, due to we discuss them later.

- **Variable bindings**

The **`let`** keyword is used in binding expressions. We can bind a name to a value or a function. Also, because the left-hand side of a let expression is a _"pattern"_, you can bind multiple names to a set of values or function values.

```rust
let a; // Declaration; without data type
a = 5; // Assignment

let b: i8; // Declaration; with data type 
b = 5;

let t = true;        // Declaration + assignment; without data type
let f: bool = false; // Declaration + assignment; with data type

let (x, y) = (1, 2); // x = 1 and y = 2

let mut z = 5;
z = 6;

let z = { x + y }; // z = 3

let z = {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;

    x + y
}; // z = 3
```

- **Constants**

The **`const`** keyword is used to define constants and after the assignment their values are not allowed to change. They live for the entire lifetime of a program but has no fixed address in the memory.

```rust
const N: i32 = 5;
```

- **Statics**

The **`static`** keyword is used to define a _"global variable"_ type facility. There is only one instance for each value, and it’s at a **fixed location in memory**.

```rust
static N: i32 = 5;
```

> 💭 While you need constants, always use `const`, instead of `static`. It’s pretty rare that you actually want a memory location associated with your constant, and using a const allows for optimizations like [constant propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding#Constant_propagation), not only in your crate but also in downstream crates.

## Variable Shadowing

Sometimes, while dealing with data, initially we get them in one unit but need to transform them into another unit for further processing. In this situation, instead of using different variable names, Rust allows us to **redeclare the same variable with a different data type and/ or with a different mutability setting**. We call this Shadowing.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: f64 = -20.48; // float
    let x: i64 = x.floor() as i64; // int
    println!("{}", x); // -21

    let s: &str = "hello"; // &str
    let s: String = s.to_uppercase(); // String
    println!("{}", s) // HELLO
}
```

## Before going to the next...

- The naming convention for the variable bindings is using the [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). But, for constants and statics, we should follow the [`SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case).

- Usually, constants and statics are placed at the top of the code file, outside the functions (after module imports/ [`use` declarations](/docs/d6.use.html)).

```rust
const PI: f64 = 3.14159265359;

fn main() {
    println!("π value is {}", PI);
}
```
