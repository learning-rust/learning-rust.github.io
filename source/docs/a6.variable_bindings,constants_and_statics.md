title: Variable bindings, Constants & Statics
---

⭐️ In Rust variables are **immutable by default**, so we call them **Variable bindings**. To make them mutable, the `mut` keyword is used.

⭐️ Rust is a **statically typed** language; it checks data types at compile time. But it **doesn’t require you to actually type it when declaring variable bindings**. In that case, the compiler checks the usage and sets a better data type for it. But for **constants and statics you must annotate the type**. Types come after a colon(:)

* ### Variable bindings

```rust
let a = true;
let b: bool = true;

let (x, y) = (1, 2);

let mut z = 5;
z = 6;
```

* ### Constants

```rust
const N: i32 = 5;
```

* ### Statics

```rust
static N: i32 = 5;
```

The **let** keyword is used in binding expressions. We can bind a name to a value or a function. Also, because the left-hand side of a let expression is a ‘pattern’, you can bind multiple names to a set of values or function values.

The **const** keyword is used to define constants. It lives for the entire lifetime of a program but has no fixed address in the memory. The **static** keyword is used to define a ‘global variable’ type facility. There is only one instance for each value, and it’s at a **fixed location in memory**.

💡 **Always use const**, instead of static. It’s pretty rare that you actually want a memory location associated with your constant, and using a const allows for optimizations like constant propagation not only in your crate but also in downstream crates.

💡 Usually statics are placed at the top of the code file, outside the functions.
