title: Cargo, Crates and Basic Project Structure
---

## Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s built-in package manager. But mainly it uses to,

- Create a new project : `cargo new`
- Update dependencies : `cargo update`
- Build project : `cargo build`
- Analyze a project to see it has any errors, without building it : `cargo check`
- Build and run a project : `cargo run`  
- Run tests : `cargo test`  
- Generate documentation via rustdoc : `cargo doc`

In addition, there are some `cargo` commands, especially for publishing crates directly via `cargo`.

- `cargo login` : Acquire an API token  
- `cargo package` : Make the local crate uploadable to crates.io  
- `cargo publish` : Make the local crate uploadable to crates.io and upload the crate

## Crate

⭐️ **A crate is a package. Crates can be shared via [Cargo](https://crates.io/).**


A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a binary crate or a library crate.  
01.  `cargo new crate_name --bin` OR `cargo new crate_name`: produces an **executable**  
02.  `cargo new crate_name --lib` : produces a **library**

The first one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

and the second one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

* **Cargo.toml**\(capital c\) is the configuration file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your project.
* **src** folder is the place to store the source code.
* Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. **main.rs** is the crate root for a binary crate and **lib.rs** is the crate root for a library crate.

> 💡 When we build a binary crate via `cargo build` or `cargo run`, the executable file will be stored in **target/debug/** folder. But when building it via `cargo build --release` for a release it will be stored in **target/release/** folder.

## Project Structure

This is how [Cargo Docs describes](http://doc.crates.io/guide.html#project-layout) about the recommended project layout,

```
.
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
├── benches
│   └── large-input.rs
├── examples
│   └── simple.rs
├── src
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── another_executable.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── main.rs
└── tests
    └── some-integration-tests.rs
```

- The source code goes in the `src` directory.  
- The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.  
- The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.  
- Other executables can be placed in `src/bin/*.rs`.  
- Integration tests go in the `tests` directory \(unit tests go in each file they're testing\).  
- Examples go in the `examples` directory.  
- Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.
