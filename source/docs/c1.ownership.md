title: Ownership
---

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = a;
    println!("{:?} {:?}", a, b); // [1, 2, 3] [1, 2, 3]
}

fn main() {
    let a = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let b = a;
    println!("{:?} {:?}", a, b); // Error; use of moved value: `a`
}
```

In the above examples, we are just trying to **assign the value of `a` to `b`** . Almost the same code in both code blocks, but having **two different data types**. And the second one gives an error. This is because of the **Ownership**.


## What is ownership?

⭐️ Variable bindings have **ownership** of what they’re bound to. A piece of data can only have **one owner at a time**. When a binding goes out of scope, Rust will free the bound resources. This is how Rust achieves **memory safety**.

> [Ownership \(noun\)](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote/blob/master/Ownership%20and%20Borrowing.pdf)  
> The act, state, or right of possessing something.

## Copy types & move types
⭐️ **When assigning** a variable binding to another variable binding **or when passing it to a function**\(Without referencing\), if its data type is a

1. **Copy Type**
   * Bound resources are **made a copy and assign** or pass it to the function.
   * The ownership state of the original bindings is set to **“copied” state**.
   * **Mostly Primitive types**
   
2. **Move type**
   * Bound resources are **moved** to the new variable binding and we **can not access the original variable binding** anymore.
   * The ownership state of the original bindings is set to **“moved” state**.
   * **Non-primitive types**

> 🔎 The functionality of a type is handled by the traits which have been implemented to it. By default, variable bindings have ‘move semantics.’ However, if a type implements [**`core::marker::Copy trait`**](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/marker/trait.Copy.html) , it has a 'copy semantics'.


💡 **So in the above second example, ownership of the Vec object moves to `b` and `a` doesn’t have any ownership to access the resource.**
