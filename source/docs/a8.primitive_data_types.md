title: Primitive Data Types
---

- ## bool
true or false

```rust
let x = true;
let y: bool = false;

// ⭐️ no TRUE, FALSE, 1, 0
```


- ## char
A single Unicode scalar value

```rust
let x = 'x';
let y = '😎';

// ⭐️ no "x", only single quotes
```
Because of Unicode support, char is not a single byte, but four.

- ## i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit fixed sized signed(+/-) integer types

| DATA TYPE | MIN                                      | MAX                                     |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| i8        | -128                                     | 127                                     |
| i16       | -32768                                   | 32767                                   |
| i32       | -2147483648                              | 2147483647                              |
| i64       | -9223372036854775808                     | 9223372036854775807                     |
| i128      | -170141183460469231731687303715884105728 | 170141183460469231731687303715884105727 |

💡 The min and max values are based on the following equation; **from -(2ⁿ⁻¹) to 2ⁿ⁻¹-1**. You can use **min_value()** and **max_value()** functions to find min and max of each integer type. ex.`i8::min_value();`


- ## u8, u16, u32, u64, u128
8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit fixed sized unsigned(0/+) integer types

| DATA TYPE | MIN | MAX                                     |
| --------- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| u8        | 0   | 255                                     |
| u16       | 0   | 65535                                   |
| u32       | 0   | 4294967295                              |
| u64       | 0   | 18446744073709551615                    |
| u128      | 0   | 340282366920938463463374607431768211455 |

💡 The min and max values are based on the following equation; **from 0 to 2ⁿ-1**. Same way you can use **min_value()** and **max_value()** functions to find min and max of each integer type. ex.`u8::max_value();`


- ## isize, usize
Pointer sized signed and unsigned integer types

The actual bit size depends on the computer architecture you are compiling your program for. By default, the sizes are equal to 32 bit on 32-bit platforms and 64 bit on 64-bit platforms.

> 🔎 Search more about [cross-compiling](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#cross-compilation) and [Supported Tiers](https://forge.rust-lang.org/platform-support.html) of Rust programs.


- ## f32, f64
32 and 64 bit sized floating point numbers(numbers with decimal points)

Rust follows IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic. The `f32` type is similar to float(**Single precision**) in other languages, while `f64` is similar to double(**Double precision**) in other languages.

💡 Should avoid using `f32`, unless you need to reduce memory consumption badly or if you are doing low-level optimization, when targeted hardware does not support for double-precision or when single-precision is faster than double-precision on it.


- ## arrays
Fixed size list of elements of same data type

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3]; // a[0] = 1, a[1] = 2, a[2] = 3
let mut b = [1, 2, 3];

let c: [i32; 0] = []; //[Type; NO of elements] -> [] /empty array
let d: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];

let e = ["my value"; 3]; //["my value", "my value", "my value"];

println!("{:?}", a); //[1, 2, 3]
println!("{:#?}", a);
//  [
//      1,
//      2,
//      3
//  ]
```

⭐️ Arrays are **immutable** by default and **even with `mut`, its element count cannot be changed**.

> 🔎 If you are looking for a dynamic/growable array, you can use [vectors](b1.vectors.html). Vectors can contain any type of elements but all elements must be in the same data type.


- ## tuples
Fixed size ordered list of elements of different(or same) data types

```rust
let a = (1, 1.5, true, 'a', "Hello, world!");
// a.0 = 1, a.1 = 1.5, a.2 = true, a.3 = 'a', a.4 = "Hello, world!"

let b: (i32, f64) = (1, 1.5);

let (c, d) = b; // c = 1, d = 1.5
let (e, _, _, _, f) = a; //e = 1, f = "Hello, world!", _ indicates not interested of that item

let g = (0,); //single-element tuple

let h = (b, (2, 4), 5); //((1, 1.5), (2, 4), 5)

println!("{:?}", a); //(1, 1.5, true, 'a', "Hello, world!")
```

⭐️ Tuples are also **immutable** by default and **even with `mut`, its element count cannot be changed. Also, if you want to change an element’s value, the new value should have the same data type of previous value**.


- ## slice
Dynamically-sized reference to another data structure

Think you want to get/pass a part of an array or any other data structure. Instead of copy it to another array (or same data structure), Rust allows creating a view/reference to access only that part of data. And it can be mutable or not.

```rust
let a: [i32; 4] = [1, 2, 3, 4];//Parent Array

let b: &[i32] = &a; //Slicing whole array
let c = &a[0..4]; // From 0th position to 4th(excluding)
let d = &a[..]; //Slicing whole array

let e = &a[1..3]; //[2, 3]
let f = &a[1..]; //[2, 3, 4]
let g = &a[..3]; //[1, 2, 3]
```


- ## str
Unsized UTF-8 sequence of Unicode string slices

```rust
let a = "Hello, world."; //a: &'static str
let b: &str = "こんにちは, 世界!";
```

⭐️ It's an **immutable/statically allocated slice** holding an **unknown sized sequence of UTF-8** code points stored in somewhere in memory. **&str** is used to borrow and assign the whole array to the given variable binding.

> 🔎 A [String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html) is a **heap**-allocated string. This string is growable and is also guaranteed to be UTF-8. They are commonly created by converting from a string slice using the **to_string()** or **String::from()** methods. ex: `“Hello”.to_string();`  `String::from("Hello");`

💡 In general, you should use **String** when you need **ownership**, and **`&str`** when you just need to **borrow a string**.


- ## functions
As we discussed on functions section, `b` is a function pointer, to `plus_one()` in the below code.

```rust
fn plus_one(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 1
}

let b: fn(i32) -> i32 = plus_one;
let c = b(5); //6
```
