title: Borrowing
---

In real life applications, most of the times we have to pass variable bindings to other functions or assign them to other variable bindings. In this case, we are **referencing** the original binding; **borrow** the data of it.

## What is Borrowing?

> [Borrow \(verb\)](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rust-tutorials-keynote/blob/master/Ownership%20and%20Borrowing.pdf)  
> To receive something with the promise of returning it.

## Shared & Mutable borrowings

⭐️ There are two types of Borrowing,

1. **Shared Borrowing** `(&T)`

   * A piece of data can be **borrowed by a single or multiple users**, but **data should not be altered**.

2. **Mutable Borrowing** `(&mut T)`

   * A piece of data can be **borrowed and altered by a single user**, but the data should not be accessible for any other users at that time.

## Rules for borrowings

There are very important rules regarding borrowing,

1. One piece of data can be borrowed **either** as a shared borrow **or** as a mutable borrow **at a given time. But not both at the same time**.

2. Borrowing **applies for both copy types and move types**.

3. The concept of **Liveness** ↴

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let b = &mut a;  //  &mut borrow of `a` starts here
                   //  ⁝
  // some code     //  ⁝
  // some code     //  ⁝
}                  //  &mut borrow of `a` ends here


fn main() {
  let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
  let b = &mut a;  //  &mut borrow of `a` starts here
  // some code

  println!("{:?}", a); // trying to access `a` as a shared borrow, so giving an error
}                  //  &mut borrow of `a` ends here


fn main() {
  let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
  {
    let b = &mut a;  //  &mut borrow of `a` starts here
    // any other code
  }                  //  &mut borrow of `a` ends here

  println!("{:?}", a); // allow borrowing `a` as a shared borrow
}
```

💡 Let’s see how to use shared and mutable borrowings in examples.

### Examples for Shared Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = &a;
    println!("{:?} {}", a, b[0]); // [1, 2, 3] 1
}


fn main() {
    let a = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let b = get_first_element(&a);

    println!("{:?} {}", a, b); // [1, 2, 3] 1
}

fn get_first_element(a: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    a[0]
}
```

### Examples for Mutable Borrowing

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = [1, 2, 3];
    let b = &mut a;
    b[0] = 4;
    println!("{:?}", b); // [4, 2, 3]
}


fn main() {
    let mut a = [1, 2, 3];
    {
        let b = &mut a;
        b[0] = 4;
    }

    println!("{:?}", a); // [4, 2, 3]
}


fn main() {
    let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let b = change_and_get_first_element(&mut a);

    println!("{:?} {}", a, b); // [4, 2, 3] 4
}

fn change_and_get_first_element(a: &mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    a[0] = 4;
    a[0]
}
```
