## Rustup
There are many ways to install Rust on your system. For the moment the official way to install Rust is using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

[📖](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/index.html) Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between **stable, beta, and nightly** compilers and keep them updated. It also makes cross-compiling simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.

[📖](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/index.html) Rustup installs **`rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`** and other standard tools to Cargo's `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`. This is the same directory that `cargo install` will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.

> 🔎 The main tools Rustup installs to the Cargo's `bin` directory,
> - `rustc`: The Rust compiler.
> - `cargo`: The Rust’s built-in package manager and the build system.
> - `rustup`: The Rust toolchain installer.
> - `rustfmt`: The Rust’s official tool of formatting Rust code according to style guidelines.
> - `cargo-fmt`: Helps to run `rustfmt` on whole Rust projects, including multi-crate workspaces.
> - `cargo-clippy`: A lint tool that provides extra checks for common mistakes and stylistic choices.
> - `cargo-miri`:An experimental Rust interpreter, which can be used for checking for undefined-behavior.
> - `rustdoc`: A local copy of the Rust documentation.
> - `rust-analyzer`: A language server that provides support for editors and IDEs.
> - `rust-gdb`: A debugger that wraps GNU Debugger(GDB).

## Installation

### For Mac and Linux Users
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### For Windows Users
Download **`rustup-init.exe`** from [www.rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and run.

> 💡 You may need to install [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) 2019 or higher, which requires an additional 3–4 GBs.

## 👨‍🏫 Before going to the next...

- To verify the current Rust version, use the **`rustc --version`** or shorter form`rustc -V` command.
- Rust follows **six week** release cycles. Use the **`rustup update`** command to update the Rust ecosystem.
- You can access Rust's offline documentation via the `rustup doc` command. 
- For a full list of `rustup` commands, refer to the `rustup --help` command.
