## Cargo

Cargo is Rust’s built-in package manager and build system. It also supports the following actions,

| Command       | Action                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `cargo new`   | Create a new project                          |
| `cargo init`  | Create a new project in an existing directory |
| `cargo check` | Verify the project compiles without errors    |
| `cargo build` | Build the executable                          |
| `cargo run`   | Build the executable and run                  |

> 💡 The `cargo check` command verifies that the project compiles without errors, without producing an executable.
> Thus, it is often faster than `cargo build`.

> 💡 Cargo places executables compiled with `cargo build` or `cargo run` in the `target/debug/` directory.
> But, while those built with **`cargo build --release`** for release purposes are stored in `target/release/` directory.
> Release builds use more optimizations and remove some runtime safety checks to increase performance, although this comes at the cost of longer compile time.

| Command        | Action                                            |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `cargo add`    | Add a dependency crate to the project             |
| `cargo remove` | Remove a dependency crate from the project        |
| `cargo fetch`  | Download the dependencies specified in Cargo.lock |
| `cargo update` | Update project dependencies                       |


> 💡 A crate is a package that can be shared via [crates.io](https://crates.io), Rust community’s crate registry.
> `cargo add`, `cargo remove`, `cargo fetch`, and `cargo update` commands manage project dependencies through the crate hosted on crates.io.

> 💡 The `cargo add` command includes a specified crate in the `[dependencies]` section of `Cargo.toml`, while `cargo add --dev` adds a crate to the `[dev-dependencies]` section. This indicates that the crate is only used for development purposes like testing and will not be included in the final compiled code.

| Command       | Action                                                                                      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cargo test`  | Run tests                                                                                   |
| `cargo bench` | Run benchmarks                                                                              |
| `cargo doc`   | Generate the project documentation via [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rustdoc/) |

In addition, there are `cargo` commands to publish the project as a crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

| Command           | Action                                                             |
| ----------------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cargo login`     | Login to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) with the API token        |
| `cargo package`   | Make the local crate uploadable to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) |
| `cargo publish`   | Upload the crate to [crates.io](https://crates.io/)                |
| `cargo install`   | Install a Rust binary                                              |
| `cargo uninstall` | Uninstall a Rust binary                                            |

> 💡 You need to get an API token from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) to publish a crate to it. The API token can be found in the [Account Settings page](https://crates.io/me), after login to that site. We will discuss more about this under [code organization with crates](/docs/crates#c-using-cratesio).

## Crate

- A crate is a package, which can be shared via Rust community’s crate registry, [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

- A crate can produce an executable or a library. In other words, it can be a **binary** crate or a **library** crate.
  1. `cargo new crate_name --bin` or `cargo new crate_name`: Produces an executable
  2. `cargo new crate_name --lib`: Produces a library

The first one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```

and the second one generates,

```
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs
```

- **Cargo.toml**\(capital c\) is the configuration file which contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile your project.
- **src** folder is the place to store the source code.
- Each crate has an implicit crate root/ entry point. **main.rs** is the crate root for a binary crate and **lib.rs** is the crate root for a library crate.

## Project Structure

This is how [Cargo documentation describes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) about the recommended project layout,

```
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.lock
├── src
│   ├── main.rs
│   ├── lib.rs
│   └── bin
│       ├── another_executable.rs
│       └── multi_file_executable
│           ├── main.rs
│           └── some_module.rs
├── tests
│   └── some_integration_tests.rs
├── benches
│   └── simple_bench.rs
└── examples
    └── simple_example.rs
```

- The source code goes in the `src` directory.
    - The default executable file is `src/main.rs`.
    - The default library file is `src/lib.rs`.
    - Other executables can be placed in,
      - `src/bin/*.rs`
      - `src/bin/*/main.rs`
- Integration tests go in the `tests` directory \(unit tests go in each file they're testing\).
- Benchmarks go in the `benches` directory.
- Examples go in the `examples` directory.

## Rust Editions

Rust guarantees backward compatibility while introducing major updates to the language. To support this, the `edition` field was added to the `Cargo.toml` file in Rust 2018, marking the first major update to the language ecosystem three years after its initial release. Editions are opt-in, meaning existing crates will not experience these changes until they explicitly migrate to the new edition.

The major editions of Rust are:

- **Rust 2015**: The initial edition, introduced with Rust 1.0. It established the core language features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, laying the foundation for Rust’s safety and concurrency guarantees.

- **Rust 2018**: The first major update, introduced the `edition` field in `Cargo.toml`, simplified the module system, stabilized `async`/`await`, improved error handling with the `?` operator, and made several syntactic changes.

- **Rust 2021**: Focused on improving ergonomics and removing inconsistencies, such as disjoint closure capture, `IntoIterator` for arrays, and the introduction of or-patterns in macros.

- **Rust 2024**: The latest edition, includes enhancements like refined `async` features, more `const` generics, better diagnostics, and improved Cargo features.

For new projects created by `cargo new`, it will set `edition = "2024"` by default in the `Cargo.toml` file. For example,

```toml
[package]
name = "hello_world"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"
```

## 👨‍🏫 Before going to the next...

- The `.cargo/bin` directory of your home directory is the default location of Rust binaries. Not only the official binaries like `rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`, `rustfmt`, `rustdoc`, `rust-analyzer` and also the binaries you can install via `cargo install` command, will be stored in this directory.

- Even though the initial convention for naming crates and file names is using the [`snake_case`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), some crate developers are using `kebab-case` on both crates and file names. To make your code more consistent, use the initial convention `snake_case`; especially on file names.

- Create an executable crate via `cargo new` command and run it via `cargo run`.

- Create a library crate via `cargo new` command and run `cargo test`.
